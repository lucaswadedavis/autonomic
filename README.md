# Autonomic

Autonomic is an effort to build a tool that breeds website layouts - but with a twist! Each of the websites produced can not only be selected for (effectively a supervised learning strategy with a Genetic Algorithm) but can me modified in vivo! (so to speak...)

These epigenetic changes (if you will) are persisted to future generations - no more waiting around for evolution to get things just right! Let nature be creative - you just make minor tweaks here and there to polish the end product.

Right now it's still in Alpha (read - buggy) so YMMV.
